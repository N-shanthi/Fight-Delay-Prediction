	<h1>Flight Delay Prediction</h1>
	<p>Air travel can be stressful enough without the added worry of flight delays. With the help of machine learning, we can predict the likelihood of a flight being delayed before it even takes off. By analyzing historical flight data and taking into account factors such as weather, airline, and airport, we can provide an estimate of whether your flight is likely to be delayed or not. This information can help you plan ahead and make any necessary adjustments to your travel plans. In this project, we'll be building a flight delay prediction model using Python and scikit-learn, and creating a web application to make predictions based on user input.</p>
